# Snappy Tkinter
G'day. 

This repository is designed to be used with a [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMq14ztdWTLvhCR2j4h_3zA) about learning to build GUI's with Python and Tkinter. It is for my students and anyone else who wants to learn how to build a Tkinter-based graphical user interface in Python.

Each video is only 5 minutes long and focuses on a particular concept, making it easy to get started learning how to build your software ideas.

Click on a link below to go to the location in this repository for the content that applies to each video. There you will find notes, pictures, code and ideas to get you up to speed quickly. 

Watching videos is great, but writing your own code is better. Let's get to it!
